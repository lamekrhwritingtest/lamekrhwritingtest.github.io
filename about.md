I included the following supplemental information to help provide context for reviewers as they evaluate some of the decisions I made while working on this writing test.

# My approach to this writing test
The bullets below capture the steps I followed while working through this writing test.

* Understand ownCloud
  * Read through the Digital Ocean guide on deploying ownCloud on Ubuntu 16.04
  * Read through the ownCloud docs (Admin and User guide)
  * Read through the Digital Ocean guide on deploying ownCloud on Ubuntu 18.04
  * Watched a YouTube video on adding users to and ownCloud instance
* Practice installing and using ownCloud
  * Followed the DO guide on deploying ownCloud for Ubuntu 16.04
    * I got stuck accessing the site. I suspect the Apache server configuration doesn’t point the url to the ownCloud folder, but I couldn’t resolve this.
  * Followed the Do guide on deploying ownCloud for Ubuntu 18.04
    * This worked for me the first time. I had some trouble connecting to the site using the desktop client, but resolved the issue by changing the user’s password immediately after creation.
* Write the procedure
  * I used my notes from my research and testing, and drafted the procedure in Google Docs
  * Brush up on Jekyll
  * Read through the Jekyll docs
  * Practiced the Jekyll quickstart
    * To accomplish this I had to set up a Ruby dev environment. This involved a number of false starts. I was unable to get Jekyll to install on my laptop (some issue with commonmark I could not resolve). After 2 failed attempts, I decided to spin up a Ruby dev environment using pre-baked instances on Google Cloud Platform.
* Set up my Github Pages / Jekyll site
  * I started by following the Jekyll quickstart
  * I added a theme, and tweaked a few things (logo, nav)
  * I finished by adding the my procedure to the site, and polishing up things like the copyright date and the theme colors.

# Notes on the content I chose to include/exclude
I made some de
ownCloud runs on a number of different platforms

# Notes on additional accounts
To complete this exercise, I set up additional Github and Gmail accounts.

I set up an additional Github account for two reasons:
I didn’t want to overwrite or add to my existing github pages site.
On the off chance that anyone at my current company was checking out my GH account, I didn’t want to trigger any suspicions about interviewing.

I set up an additional Gmail account to verify my Github account, but also so I could use the associated free GCP trial for my Ruby dev environment.
