layout: quickstart
---
# Overview
- quickstart to get you up and running in owncloud.
- owncloud is an open source file sharing platform

# Prereq
- streamlined by using Ubuntu 18 and standard lamp server
- cert recommended (I need to test if the install and user connect works without it, and what other warnings if any appear.)

# Install owncloud
- Update pkg manager
- add owncloud pkg
- configure db
- use web UI for install

# Add a user account
- log in to the web UI as an admin
- click hamburger menu, select users
- fill in the user info (note about using a new, non-admin group.)
- reset password (This is what I need to double check. With the current default workflow, I don't know where to set the pass, and if it is set, I don't know what it is set to.)

# Connect with a user account
- number of options, we show using the Mac OSX client
- open desktop client
- enter server address (what if I already entered a server, and I want to add another or change?)
- enter username and pass, then click conect

# Conclusion
Gets you up and running
